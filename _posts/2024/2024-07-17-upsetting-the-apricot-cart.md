title: "Upsetting the Apricot Cart"
---

Imagine for a minute that I had a pair of apricot trees in my garden. I don't actually have a garden, so you'll have to imagine that I have one of those too. I love a nice fresh ripe apricot. However, I can't eat every single apricot that comes off the trees—there are just too many! There aren't enough apricots to start an apricot-selling business, plus I've got a job anyway. Instead I setup a stall in the street and give away my apricots to anyone passing by that shares my love of stone fruits. After a while word gets around and people in the neighbourhood know that they can get some apricots from Will's stall, and they'll drop by to see if I've got any to give away.

Someone puts up a sign at the end of the street: "Tasty Free Apricots from Will's Tree!". It's not what I would've done, but to be fair it is a bit difficult to find my stall, so making it easier to find is convenient for me too. I'm happy that more people appreciate the apricots, and I enjoy talking about fruit with the people that stop by. Having a few more people turn up that like apricots but didn't otherwise know about my stall is nice.

A little later, someone notices my stall and the boxes of fruit that I have sitting behind it. They take a box of apricots and give them away at a local market.

Multiple people have the same idea—it entices more people to their stand if they've got apricots to give away. Some of them will tell shoppers where the apricots came from—and where they can find more themselves—but others don't pass that information on to whoever is attending their stand.

When I find out, I'm a little put out by this. My friends say that the result is the same—the apricots get given away to people that want them, what's the problem? Wasn't the whole point of this stall to give away the fruit that I didn't need?

They don't understand that while yes, I was giving away the fruit for free so I haven't lost anything financially. What I have lost is a connection with the people that received the fruit. I don't get to see that they appreciate it, they don't come back and tell me about the desert they cooked with the apricots last week. They can't see the time and effort that I put in to building the stall, or hear about my many apricot recipe recommendations.

Completely unrelated to that imaginary scenario, on this website I share my thoughts, opinions, and projects I've been working on. I'm happy to give them away because I have such an abundance of opinions I have to put them _somewhere_, and I'm self-aware enough to know that no one would be bothered paying for this nonsense. However I write with the hope that readers will appreciate not just the ideas, but the way the ideas are presented, both in how they're written and how they're presented on my website.
