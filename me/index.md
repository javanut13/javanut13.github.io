# Hi!

I'm Will - a software engineer and photographer from New Zealand, living in Sydney.

![picture of Will walking across a swing bridge, holding a camera tripod](/images/me.jpg)

In 2017 I graduated from the University of Canterbury with a degree in Software Engineering. I've been programming since 2008, using as many languages as possible and on any platform with an SDK - including Java ME on a knockoff Nexus One, and a custom watchface for the [original Pebble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_(watch)).

I'm a strong believer in open-source software and open standards. You can find the projects that I have published on [Github](https://github.com/willhbr), which I will often mention here.

Since 2018 I've been working at [Google](https://google.com) in Sydney. Previously as an [SRE](https://sre.google) in database infrastructure, and now on Maps for Android Automotive.
